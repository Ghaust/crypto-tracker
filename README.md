# Crypto Tracker Bot

Messenger bot developed for my personal use. Its purpose is to help me track better value of cryptocurrencies. The tasks are not fixed, I will probably add new features every time I think of one or if I feel like trying out a new technology.

### Remaining tasks:
- [x] Communication with Messenger API (Flask)
- [x] Crypto API to get informations
- [ ] Subscription Feature
- [ ] Store subscribed users in JSON or in Firebase Realtime DB
- [ ] Send updates automatically for a specific cryptocurrency chosen by subscribed users
- [ ] Improve messages structure (style)
- [ ] Use Giphy API to retrieve gifs from specific use case/market value
